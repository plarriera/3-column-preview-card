## 🌱 My process

### 🚀 Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox

### 📚 What I learned

This was a quick challenge I took to grow more confident using CSS Flexbox, on top of the Git knowledge I gained during the [QR Code Component Challenge](https://github.com/plarriera/qr-code-component). For Flexbox, [FLEX](https://flexbox.malven.co/) by Malven. Co. was an extremely helpful cheatsheet that I will keep at hand for future projects.

### 💡 Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to try my hand at making more complex layouts solely with Flexbox in order to test my knowledge and creative thinking.
